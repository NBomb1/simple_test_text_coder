# About script
That is just test and simple decoder/coder.



# Requires
Python 3.8

Please install "urllib3" to use script.




# Details
My first version doesn't support digits.

I made it just for testing my python skills.

I don't know, but for me it works only in cmd or PyCharm

I am still working for that coder.



# Script downloading
You have to download only updater.py



# About Auto-Update script

It may has some errors, because it's first time when I tried to make it.

I also think it works only on Windows.



# Deleting files
That coder may delete those kind files: "updateCoderScriptNB.py" and "coder.py"

P.S: Thats happens because of my Auto-Update script.
