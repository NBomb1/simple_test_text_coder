# simple_test_text_coder
That is just test and simple decoder/coder.

Please install "urllib3" to use script.

In my first version digits are unsupportable.

That coder may delete those kind files: updateCoderScriptNB.py and coder.py
P.S: Thats happens because of my Auto-Update script.

I made it just for test my python skills.

You have to download only updater.py

I don't know, but for me it works only in cmd or PyCharm

I am still working for that coder.
